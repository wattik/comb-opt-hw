| cocontest_op  | Optimal Time-Constrained Traveling Salesman Problem       | Integral Linear Programming (ILP) | Problem inspired by kiwi.com TSP competition. The task is to find a round trip visiting given set of airports, minimizing the total air-ticket costs. In this version, optimal route is expected.            |
| cocontest_t   | Approximative Time-Constrained Traveling Salesman Problem | TSP, k-opt approximation          | Same as the above, but for bigger problem instances (>50 cities), thus approximative solution is expected. I used 4-opt approximation of TSP within the simulated annealing framework, plus several tweaks.  |
